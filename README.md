TASK
An overseas investor from Hong   Kong   is   interested   in   smart home   development   opportunities   in Brisbane.   She is considering developing a unit complex in the area and needs assistance to   identify potential development sites. Your task is to prepare a report that recommends potential   sites that meet the investor’s requirements.
The investor would like to develop an apartment building of   2 storeys.   She is looking   for a   site   that will have a   straightforward planning approval process. The   development should therefore be   either Accepted, or Code Assessable development under the Brisbane City Council’s current   planning   scheme   (excluding neighbourhood plan requirements). The   site must be located   in   the   low-medium   density residential zone, and   should not be affected by river   or   creek   flooding   (but   a   site affected by overland flooding   is   acceptable). Additionally,   the   site   must   not   to   be   affected   by mapping that   shows biodiversity may be a   concern.   The   site   should   also   not be   located   within any   state Priority Development   Area.
The property itself should   be large enough to   site   the   desired   development, by   having   a   site   area   equal   to, or   greater   than   800m² (as   large   as   possible),   and   should   be   located   within   walking   distance of   high-quality public transport (operational and planned   train   stations;   maximum   400m. distance   and   as   close   as   possible).
The investor wants a   simple purchase and   is   therefore   seeking   to buy   only   a   single   lot   rather than assembling multiple blocks. Vacant land is   ideal   and   is   the   developer’s   first   preference,   however land currently used as   a   detached   dwelling may   also   be   acceptable.   Older,   small   scale apartment buildings or motels would also be   acceptable provided   they are   located   on   a   single   lot   and   therefore   not   under   multiple   ownership   (i.e., not   strata   or   community   titled   lots). Land   currently used for commercial purposes (shopping, offices, retail, etc.), highrise towers, or   modern unit developments, are likely to be   too   expensive,   and   therefore   not   acceptable.
Likewise, lots currently used for car parking are   also   not   acceptable.


Preliminary plans for development are to be   prepared   by   the   investor’s   architectural   firm   once   you have identified a   site that best meets   the   investor’s   criteria.   To   assist the   architect,   your   report needs to describe the following key   planning   scheme   requirements   based   on   information   available in Council’s relevant codes (excluding   neighbourhood   plan   requirements):
            Maximum height;
            Building   setbacks;
            Site   cover;
            The amount of   private open   space   required   per   unit;
            The amount of   required   communal open   space;
            The number of   car parks required per unit.
Additional requirements, formatting and other suggestions are   shown on   the   following pages.
REPORT STRUCTURE
The report   should include the   following   sections:

Preliminaries
            Table of   Contents
            Table of   Figures
            Table   of   Tables
1. Executive Summary
            A succinct summary of   your report. It should outline the task, methods used, and the   results.
2. Introduction
            The purpose of   the report, and   details   of   the   task.
            A   summary of   what the reader can expect in   each   section   of   the report.


3. Methodology
            Description of   the   steps followed for the   analysis,   from   the   first   step   (understanding the   information   and   criteria   sheets) to   the   last   step   (writing   the   report), including   the analysis of   the   shapefiles/maps and a rationale that explains   each   step   and   how   you   formed your recommendations.
            The   report   is   to   use   a   multi‐criteria   analysis   (MCA) as   a   part   of   its   methodology, and include   a   table   that   outlines   the   criteria   used   for   the   MCA, its   calculations, and   a   rationale for these criteria. This analysis is particularly   useful   to   rank   the   remaining   sites once the “hard” constraints have   been   accounted   for.   If   needed, you   are   free   to   consider other criteria as well, using   data provided   and/or   available   online   (e.g.,   proximity to parks/bike lanes/bus   stations/else).
            The data used   for   analysis, including:
o   the name of   the   shapefile/map used;
o   the   source of   the shapefile/map;
o   the   information   used   for   that   shapefile/map   (e.g.,   tram   stop   location).
            A   table   or   diagram   that   explains   your   method   in   detail   and   which   includes   the   information   shown in the   following table:StepsGoalsActionsResultsGIS analysis (if applicable to the step)Data usedArcGIS Pro   tool(s) usedData produced1.…1.

代做程序编程语言 and/or   Google   Street   View   to   ensure   your   selected   sites   are   meeting   the   client’s criteria, particularly those related to existing   uses.   It   is   recommended   that   this   step occurs towards the end of   your   analysis   to   minimise   the number   of   sites   that   require this form. of   manual   inspection.
4. Results
            This   section   should   summarise the results, including:
o   A map of   the sites that meet all the conditions presented in this information sheet,   prepared in ArcGIS   Pro;
o   Another map that classifies site suitability as determined by your MCA and any   visual analysis, and a   discussion   of   the results   shown   on   the   map;
o   A   short‐list of   a least three   suitable   sites that have been   identified using   your   analysis. This   should include a detailed   development profile   of   each   site   and   site photos (aerial images and   google   street view   are   acceptable).   The development profile is to include the key planning   scheme   requirements   described in the brief. The template below outlines the information that should   be   included   as   a   minimum   for   each   site. You   may   use   a   different   layout   if   you feel it improves communication.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation
            This section summarises the report and makes a final recommendation for one of   the      short-listed   sites. The final recommendation must describe why   this   site   is   preferred   over the other short‐listed   sites, making reference to   the   client’s   preferences   as described in   the brief.
